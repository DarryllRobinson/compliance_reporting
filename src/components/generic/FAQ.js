    question: "1. Who is required to report under the new PTRS scheme?",
    answer:
      "Only entities that meet the new definition of a reporting entity under the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 are required to report. This includes the highest-level entity in a corporate group that meets consolidated revenue and control criteria.",
  },
  {
    question: "2. What payments need to be included in the report?",
    answer:
      "Entities must report payments made under trade credit arrangements to Australian small businesses, excluding payments to government or employees, and subject to specific rules around credit cards and ABNs.",
  },
  {
    question: "3. How do we use the SBI Tool?",
    answer:
      "The SBI Tool must be used after each reporting period to identify small business suppliers based on the calendar year in which the reporting period ended. It is only available via the PTRS Portal.",
  },
  {
    question: "4. What if we submit our report using the old CSV template?",
    answer:
      "Reports submitted using the CSV template for periods commencing after 1 July 2024 will be rejected. The new scheme requires reports to be submitted through the Portal's webform interface.",
  },
  {
    question: "5. When is the report due?",
    answer:
      "Reports must be submitted within 3 months of the end of the reporting period. Most entities will report biannually based on their financial year.",
  },
  {
    question: "6. What if we acquire or lose control of an entity?",
    answer:
      "You must report on payments by all entities you control at the end of the reporting period. If data is not accessible, section 15 of the Rules allows exclusions with disclosures.",
  },
  {
    question: "7. Are credit card payments included?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if they meet the criteria of a trade credit arrangement, exceed $100 (incl. GST), and are not excluded under a genuinely enforced policy or other exceptions.",
  },
  {
    question: "8. Can we request more time to submit our report?",
    answer:
      "Yes, via the Portal. Extensions of up to 28 days require a reason, while longer extensions need supporting documentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "9. Do we need to submit supporting datasets?",
    answer:
      "No, but you must retain them for seven years. The TCP and SBTCP datasets are essential for calculating required metrics.",
  },
  {
    question: "10. What help is available if we get stuck?",
    answer:
      "You're not alone — our platform is designed to guide you through each step with clarity and confidence. Clear instructions, integrated tips, and contextual help are built into the platform, so you can move forward without needing to leave the platform.",
