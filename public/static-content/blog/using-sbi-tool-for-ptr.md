# How to Use the SBI Tool to Flag Small Business Payments

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

One of the most important parts of Payment Times Reporting is determining whether your suppliers are small businesses. The Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool — provided by the Regulator — helps you do exactly that. Here's how to use it effectively and avoid common errors.

## What Is the SBI Tool?

The SBI Tool is a government-provided service that allows reporting entities to upload a list of supplier ABNs and receive a validated output showing which are not considered small businesses.

Only the Regulator’s tool may be used for this classification — manual determination or internal guesswork is not acceptable under the legislation.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Prepare Your ABN List

Export a list of all supplier ABNs associated with payments made in the reporting period. Make sure:

- ABNs are correctly formatted (11 digits, no dashes or spaces)
- Duplicates are removed

### 2. Upload to the SBI Tool

- Access the SBI Tool from the Regulator’s website
- Upload your CSV or paste in the ABNs as per instructions
- Download the resulting output, which shows ABNs that are _not_ small businesses

### 3. Import into Your PTR Platform

In Monochrome Compliance, upload the SBI Tool output to match and flag payments automatically. This step ensures your submission accurately distinguishes small business transactions.

## Tips and Gotchas

- Always use the latest version of the SBI Tool
- Double-check that your ABNs haven’t been corrupted or truncated in Excel
- Don’t manually flag suppliers — it must come from the tool
- Run the check as close to submission time as practical for accuracy
