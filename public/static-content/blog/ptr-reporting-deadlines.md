# PTR Reporting Deadlines: What You Need to Know

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

PTR reporting deadlines are fixed and recurring. Missing them can result in financial penalties and reputational consequences. Here's everything you need to know to ensure you stay on track.

## Reporting Periods

The Payment Times Reporting Scheme operates on a biannual reporting schedule:

- **First half-year reporting period:**  
  Covers 1 January – 30 June  
  **Report due by 30 September**

- **Second half-year reporting period:**  
  Covers 1 July – 31 December  
  **Report due by 31 March**

These deadlines are not flexible — late submissions are published on the Regulator’s website and may attract fines.

## Internal Planning Tips

- **Start early:** Begin data collection at least 6 weeks before the deadline
- **Assign responsibility:** Designate a compliance lead to coordinate the submission
- **Build reminders:** Add internal calendar alerts for key milestones
- **Run dry submissions:** Validate your data in advance to avoid surprises

## What Happens If You Miss the Deadline?

The Regulator may:

- Publish your non-compliance on the public register
- Impose monetary penalties
- Notify other government departments, affecting your eligibility for contracts
