# What’s Changed in PTR Legislation in 2025?

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

The Payment Times Reporting Scheme (PTRS) has seen a number of regulatory changes in 2025. These adjustments clarify definitions, improve transparency, and strengthen enforcement. If you're responsible for compliance reporting, understanding these updates is essential.

## Key Legislative Changes

### 1. Updated Definition of Small Business

The Regulator has aligned the definition of a "small business" with the Australian Bureau of Statistics classification, refining eligibility criteria for supplier classification. The SBI Tool must still be used to validate ABNs.

### 2. Reporting Thresholds Clarified

Legislation now explicitly confirms that entities earning **exactly** $100 million in annual income are captured under the scheme — closing a previous interpretation gap.

### 3. Increased Penalties for Late or False Reporting

Non-compliance penalties have increased significantly, including:

- Higher monetary fines
- Reputational exposure on the Regulator’s public register
- Potential disqualification for government tenders

### 4. Changes to Reporting Timeframes

Reporting deadlines remain biannual, but extensions are now subject to stricter criteria. Late submissions require a formal justification and may be subject to regulatory review.

## How This Affects You

Compliance teams and finance leads should review internal processes to ensure:

- Data is prepared earlier in the reporting cycle
- Supplier ABNs are regularly reviewed
- Governance controls are in place to support the new enforcement standards
