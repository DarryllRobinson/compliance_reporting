# Avoid These Common PTR Submission Mistakes

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

Submitting your Payment Times Reporting (PTR) data accurately is critical — not just for compliance, but for your reputation. This article outlines the most frequent submission errors and how to avoid them using best practices and modern tools.

## 1. Incorrect Supplier Classification

**Problem:** ABNs not validated through the Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool, or manually flagged incorrectly.

**Fix:** Always upload your ABN list to the SBI Tool, then import the result into your PTR system. Never guess or assume.

## 2. Incomplete or Inconsistent Data

**Problem:** Missing required fields, inconsistent payment dates, or invoice records that don't reconcile with accounting systems.

**Fix:** Use a tool like Monochrome Compliance to validate your data before exporting. Check for missing values and date mismatches.

## 3. Outdated CSV Templates

**Problem:** Using a previous version of the CSV template, which may have missing or renamed columns.

**Fix:** Always download or use the latest validated CSV structure. Monochrome Compliance always outputs the current format.

## 4. Late Submissions

**Problem:** Data is ready too late in the reporting cycle, or key signoffs are delayed internally.

**Fix:** Set internal deadlines earlier than the official due date and assign clear responsibilities. Use calendar reminders or workflow tools.

## 5. No Internal Review Process

**Problem:** Reports are submitted without secondary review, increasing the chance of human error.

**Fix:** Introduce a two-step signoff process before submission. Store signed PDFs for auditing purposes.
