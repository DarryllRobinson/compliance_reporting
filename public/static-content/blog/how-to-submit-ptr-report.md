# How to Submit a PTR Report

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

Submitting a Payment Times Reporting (PTR) report is a regulatory requirement for large businesses in Australia. This step-by-step guide walks you through how to prepare, validate, and submit your report correctly — and with confidence.

## Who Needs This?

This article is for reporting entities with over $100 million in total annual income that are required to submit PTR reports twice yearly. It is particularly relevant for financial controllers, reporting officers, governance leads and compliance managers tasked with PTR reporting.

## Step-by-Step Submission Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Gather invoice and payment data for all suppliers across the reporting period. You’ll need:

- Payment dates
- Invoice dates
- Supplier ABNs
- Contract terms (if applicable)

Ensure the data aligns with the reporting window (either Jan–Jun or Jul–Dec) and reflects payments made during the period.

### Step 2: Identify Small Business Suppliers

Export all supplier ABNs and upload them to the Regulator’s Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool. The tool returns a list of ABNs that are **not** small businesses. Import that result into Monochrome Compliance to flag small business payments accordingly.

### Step 3: Format the PTR Report

Using Monochrome Compliance, import your data into the validated CSV format. The system checks for:

- Missing or invalid fields
- Small business flag consistency
- Payment term compliance

Correct any issues and regenerate the output CSV.

### Step 4: Lodge the Report

Log into the Regulator’s portal and upload your validated CSV. You’ll also complete a summary form and submit the PTR declaration electronically.

We recommend downloading a PDF of your final submission for internal records.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use my own template?**  
No — you must use the Regulator’s approved CSV layout. Monochrome Compliance outputs this format for you automatically.

**What if I discover errors after submission?**  
Contact the Regulator immediately. You may be able to submit a corrected version within the reporting period.

**Do I need to identify small businesses manually?**  
You must upload ABNs to the SBI Tool and process the results. This is the only compliant method.
